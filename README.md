# Speech Analysis and Gender Classification System

## Overview

This MATLAB project is designed for analog communication systems, specifically on speech analysis and gender classification. The system utilizes frequency analysis to determine whether the speaker is male or female and identifies specific spoken words from a predefined set.

## Features

1. **Gender Classification:**
   - The system analyzes the input speech signals to classify the speaker as either male or female based on distinctive frequency characteristics.

2. **Word Detection:**
   - The program identifies and reports the occurrence of specific words within the spoken content. The predefined set of detectable words includes "food," "bird," "cat," and "fly."

3. **Analog Communication System Integration:**
   - This project is suitable for analog communication system applications, providing a practical implementation of speech analysis for gender classification.

## Dependencies

- MATLAB R2019a or later

## Installation

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Luci-MG/Analog-Communication-Speech-Analysis.git
```
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
1. Run the main script: 'training.m'

# Usage

1. **Speech Input:**
   - Provide the speech input by speaking into a microphone connected to the system or providing pre-recorded audio files.

2. **Analysis Results:**
   - The system will output the gender classification (male/female) based on frequency analysis.
   - Detected words from the predefined set ("food," "bird," "cat," "fly") will be reported.

# Acknowledgments

- This project was developed as part of the Analog Communication semester-end project.
